# 🌟 Animated Components

Welcome to my **Animated Components**, a fun and creative collection of interactive UI elements that I’m building while practicing with **Framer Motion** and **React**.  

This repo is my little playground 🎨—a place where buttons bounce, navbars glide, and micro-interactions bring life to everyday components.  


## ✨ Why This Repo Exists  
When I started diving into UI animations, I realized how much a small detail (like a ripple on a button) can transform the entire feel of a product. So, I began building these components not just to practice coding animations, but also to:  
- **Explore new ideas** 💡 and animation patterns.  
- **Learn by doing** instead of only reading docs.  
- **Share my journey** with other developers and designers.  
- **Provide inspiration** for anyone who wants to make interfaces more alive.  


## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **React** – UI framework  
- **Framer Motion** – animation magic  
- **Tailwind CSS** (optional styling)  


## 📂 What’s Inside  
The repo is organized into component categories.  
- Buttons
- Cards
- More parts coming soon (hover effects, navbars, and beyond!)

Each component includes:  
- ✅ Clean and reusable code  
- 🎬 Smooth animations powered by Framer Motion  
- 🎨 A focus on detail, aesthetics, and user experience


## 💖 Contribute / Feedback

This repo is a personal learning journey, but if you’d like to share ideas, feedback, or contribute, I’d love to hear from you! Open an issue or drop a PR.


## 🌟 Stay Connected

I’ll keep adding new components to this Repo, so keep an eye out for more!
